  <li>
    Worked with a highly dynamic farming dashboard for an international
    audience. Made use of Redux to manage complex state interactions and used
    time travel debugging to discover existing state, debug, and build new
    features.
  </li>

  <li>
    Developed reusable and modular components for weather features from scratch
    that respected timezones for fields rather than for the user&apos;s
    location.
  </li>

  <li>
    Made use of i18next to handle language translations and encourage heavy use
    of JavaScript&apos;s Intl API to properly format dates for specific locales,
    as well as numbers for units such as acres, hectares, Fahrenheit and
    Celsius.
  </li>

  <li>
    Built PDF reporting API from scratch using ReactPDF to server render field
    reports which could be retrieved and downloaded on GET requests. This
    project was linted with ESLint, built with Docker, and automated tests set
    to run on GitLab. Deployments used the companies' custom Go CLI to push to
    Kubernetes based on git tags.
