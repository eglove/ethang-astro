  <b>LegrandAV, 11/23–05/24</b>: I led an upgrade from vanilla React and
  Sitecore to Next.js. The project had been at a standstill for 2 months due to
  hosting problems. We got it running within a few weeks and moved on to a
  redesign of the user dashboard. I encouraged the team to move away from
  outsourcing to markup services for frontend work and make use of accessible
  libraries such as NextUI.

  <b>St. Louis County, 06/23–08/23</b>: Introduced automated testing to legacy
  codebases by setting up and writing unit tests for .NET backends as well as
  E2E and accessibility testing for React frontends. The challenge with
  introducing tests to legacy codebases is that test runners sometimes expect
  the best practices that they enforce. For example, React state was not being
  handled immutably. While it seemed the applications were fine on manual
  review, tests revealed different states between renders. This was causing many
  difficult to reproduce bugs. This means getting tests set up would require
  significant refactoring, even entire rewrites. This is why we pivoted to a
  focus on E2E as much as possible.

  <b>Proagrica, 12/22–05/23</b>: Worked with a highly dynamic farming dashboard
  for an international audience. Made use of Redux to manage complex state
  interactions and used time travel debugging to discover existing state, debug,
  and build new features.

  <b>EPA, 06/22–11/22</b> Helped rebuild Emissions Collection and Monitoring System
  (ECMPS) for reporting emission data with a new tech stack. I was one of three developers
  building the backend. We made an effort to always increase test coverage. The result
  was QA asking for us to slow down because our production was too fast and not revealing
  issues. This gave us time to produce more reproducible examples and help QA to
  ensure the highest quality possible.

  included features such as P2P video conferences, chat, phone calls, calendar,
  file sharing and more. All with realtime notifications between users and teams
  provided by websockets and styled with CSS modules. I was by myself on this
  project tasked with bringing a general idea to life.
